## Branching Workflow Strategy

Since the team is composed by one member only, I have decided to opt for a simple branching workflow.

This workflow is based on a **master** branch that will host the _production software_.<br>
Instead of being committed directly on the master branch, changes to the code base will be carried on the **development** branch.<br>
Once the software in the development branch is ready to be deployed, development branch will be merged with the master one.<br>
A **bug fix** branch could be created when needed in order to fix bugs that have been found in the production software.

A graphic view of the workflow strategy can be observed in the image below:<br><br>
